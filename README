The primary goal of this integration is to establish a seamless linkage between requirements managed in Codebeamer and Git commits within Github. By achieving this linkage, we aim to enhance tracking and traceability throughout the software development lifecycle. This integration will facilitate the correlation of specific requirements with the corresponding Git commits, thereby enabling better visibility into the evolution of the codebase in alignment with project requirements. Through this enhanced tracking and traceability, teams can ensure that software changes are consistently aligned with stakeholder requirements, fostering greater transparency and accountability in the development process.
